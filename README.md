# Sentiment Analysis with K-Nearest Neighbors

This repository contains the implementation of a sentiment analysis model using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, as part of the HW1 assignment for the Department of Computer Science at Mason University.

## Assignment Overview

The aim is to apply the K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm to infer sentiment (polarity) from free-form text reviews for a range of products. The sentiment is classified as positive (+1) or negative (-1) based on the review content.

## Dataset

The `data` folder includes:

- `test_data.txt`: The test file containing 10,000 reviews without ground truth sentiments.
- `train_data.txt`: The training file with reviews and corresponding sentiment scores.
